### Sorting

This will cover: *Intervals, Search Space, Comparison, Algorithms*

###### Instructions:

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in-place.  This is similar to the "Binary Search" problem but could be better for more senior developers.

Simplest: Insertion-Sort.  Merge-Sort is interesting too, especially in-place which might be hard to do.  Hard: Q-Sort â€“ besides difficulty of implementation, it's natural for in-place, and easy to talk about complex things like expected-time versus worst-time, strategies for lessening worst-time, what happens if list is pre-sorted, etc.
