### ProjectName

This will cover: *Sequence Processing, Big-O, Recurrence, Algorithms, Testability*

###### Instructions:

Given an integer, print every prime less than or equal to that integer, one per line.

How fast can you make the algorithm if you're allowed only small, fixed amount of storage?  (e.g. only check odd numbers, or every-other-odd (to skip multiples of 3), only check factors up to sqrt(N))

How fast can you make the algorithm if you're allowed arbitrary amount of storage?  (e.g. store all found-so-far primes, then check divisibility only by those for each successive number)
